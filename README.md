1. `fit_scenarios.m` generates the figure seen in the main text with various fitting
2. `plot_r_dependencies.m` plots the various inputs to the scenarios found in the supplemental material
3. `sweep_params_simple.m` plots the parameter sweeps found in the supplemental material
4. `plot_geometries_and_hetero.m` plots the geometry inputs generated by `sweep_geometries.m`
5. `fit_PDE_models.m` fits the models to obtain the parameter values used throughout the other scripts
6. `sweep_PDEsolves_with_fits.m`generates the visual 2D solutions with the fitted values, seen in the main text figure
